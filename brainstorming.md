**Ideas:**
1. G2 Esports app to follow the organization across many esports
2. Rocket League app to follow upcoming events in the esport or follow specific teams
3. NHL app to track niche statistics that you won't find tracked on the official app
4. NHL app to track statistics for certain teams that the user chooses

**Evaluations:**
1. API for liquipedia is too difficult to use and not very feasible
2. API for liquipedia is too difficult to use and not very feasible
3. Something I enjoy with a reasonably usable API
4. Something I enjoy with a reasonably usable API

**FINAL IDEA:** NHL app to track niche statistics that aren't found on the official app, allowing users to change settings to view certain teams or enable notifications for rare statistics
