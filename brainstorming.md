# Top 3 Ideas:
1. G2 Esports app to follow the organization across many esports
2. Rocket League app to follow upcoming events in the esport or follow specific teams
3. NHL app to track niche statistics that you won't find tracked on the official app

# Evaluations:
## G2 App:
**Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- Would add options for push notifications for certain esports or events

**Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- Would likely be well accepted as an idea, however the G2 organization already has an app that does what I planned

**Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
- Several thousands of people follow the G2 organization, showing a desire for the team

**Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- Could be habit-forming in regularly checking the app to view new upcoming events, but there is no ability for users to create anything

**Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- The API I planned on using wound up being too difficult to use, similar to other wikimedia APIs
- A stripped-down version would likely still be interesting to build, given that it is something I am interested in

## Rocket League App:
**Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- Would add options for push notifications for certain esports or events
- Would have an option to search for any upcoming or ongoing events that area nearby the user

**Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- Would likely be well accepted as an idea and possibly successful if implemented properly

**Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
- Hundreds of thousands of people play Rocket League and follow events in the esport, showing there is an audience

**Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- Could be habit-forming in regularly checking the app to view new upcoming events, but there is no ability for users to create anything

**Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- The API I planned on using wound up being too difficult to use, similar to other wikimedia APIs
- A stripped-down version would likely still be interesting to build, given that it is something I am interested in

## NHL App:
**Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- Would implement the option to enable push notifications for rare statistics
- Could try and have a feature to search for statistics only including players born within a certain radius on a map

**Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- For individuals such as myself who find value in these niche statistics, I believe it would be a very valuable resource

**Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
- The NHL is the highest level of professional hockey, with millions of fans worldwide
- I have noticed the interest in hockey statistics and data increase over the past several years

**Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- Users might use the app daily to check updated statistics
- Difficult to have a way for users to create things

**Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- The NHL API is straightforward to use, and I have experience with it in the past
- I have already made very stripped-down versions of this app and have still enjoyed them

# Final Idea: NHL App 
- Track niche statistics that aren't found on the official app
- Allow users to change settings to view statistics for certain teams
- Option to enable push notifications for statistics that occur rarely
